          Having regular volunteering work at church, students with SEN are not something new for me. Chatting with them, grabbing things for them, playing games with them. I never imagine what else I can do for them, to improve their behaviors, not just the external environment. SIGHT has given me not only the opportunity to help these kids directly, but also the inspiration that we can look for changes anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
          I always thought special schools have similar structure and design with mainstream schools, but when I first entered Caritas Lok Kan School, I was amazed by all the detailed integration of barrier-free facilities into their campus, and customised toys and equipment for body training, which are not commonly available in public. After the visit, our team set edutainment with body training as our project direction, and this is how CollaBox 盒。作started.
          </p>
          <p>
          “CollaBox” comes from “Collaboration” and “Box”, while “盒。作” can implies “ 盒的作品” (Crafted box) and “合作” (Collaboration). Both the Chinese and English names highlight two elements, collaboration and box. Our team designed a multiplayer computer game that requires more than one student to complete, which is being played with our self-designed game controller. We figure out students
lack communication and interaction at school, which is understandable as different physical barriers have limited their movement. Most of their communications are done with teachers or caretakers only. We hope to raise their awareness of the external environment, which is other students’ presence and actions, with CollaBox. So, in our game design, we have created numerous stages which students can proceed to only when they have completed the collaboration game in each stage. The Box, which consists of a joystick and button, is designed to train students’ grasping ability and movement.
          </p>
          <p>
          Not every student in Caritas has a long attention span and motivation for class, which prompts us to include two more elements in CollaBox, animations and a reward system. As the school is located in Tin Shui Wai and students are often brought around the area, we set the game theme as going to school from the light rail transit station. Not being familiar with the district, me and my partner picked a date to visit the district in-depth to get inspiration and reference for the animations. Octopus cards, light rail trains, items which students are frequently exposed to are included
in the animations and graphics. But here came the challenge, I had only a little basic knowledge on animation and graphic design, neither did I have good artistics sense. I started watching tutorial videos online to learn more about the animating skills, and frequently went to my teammates for comments. Luckily, my teammates were very supportive and gave me interesting directions to improve the animations. I can’t say I am a pro at animations now, but at least I have got the skills :P (This is also one of the things I like about SIGHT, you have to step out of your comfort zone always, but not alone!).
          </p>
          <p>
          Apart from animations, rewards are needed to keep students engaged and motivated throughout the whole game. As humans, we all want to be recognised for our achievements, so as the students. In CollaBox, physical toy trains and rails are continuously provided to students when they proceed to different stages. At the end, a complete route would be built. Originally we tried to build our own train rails using materials available in the lab like cardboard, acrylic board or wood board, but it was much harder than we expected. Some materials were too hard to be cut through, some were not safe, some could be torn easily. Nothing works better than already- available toys out there, which is also our final solution. However, it was fun when everyone came together and tried out different materials for the toy.
          </p>
          <p>
          Although with the pandemic, our team cannot go into the school to implement CollaBox in person, the whole project experience is very rewarding for us, and hopefully for the students too. We are all trying to make changes to the SEN students’ habits, to make them more adaptable to the external environment, not only making the environment more adaptable for them.

          As one of the editors of this book, I’ve had the privilege to hear and write about many experiences, thoughts and reflections with SIGHT. I don’t feel like writing about what SIGHT encompasses anymore, so I thought I’d tell a story of how SIGHT fits into my growth, the journey of finding myself and my place in the world.
          </p>
          <p>The story started in 2019, when I joined HKUST as an undergraduate. To be honest the academic journey ahead didn’t sound really exciting to me. I knew university was a time for me to expose myself to different voices and experiences, to formulate
my thoughts and to test my beliefs. I just didn’t know how. One thing I knew though was I wanted to make a positive change, but to do that I had so much more to
learn. Fortunately SIGHT’s ideology seemed to check all the boxes. Joining SIGHT was the best decision I’ve made at HKUST, but it was also so much more. It is a rite of passage in my journey of believing that I can, and I should strive to make that difference.</p>
          <p>
          I was very grade conscious back then. Inevitably, your CGA is more or less what determines what kind of scholarship, exchange and internship opportunities you would be getting. Having grown up in an exam-oriented environment where syllabi, past papers and even grade boundaries have always been widely accessible, signing up for the project course rips me away from the comfort zone of predictable achievement. Beyond the grading, not knowing my team, having no right answer and no well-defined paths worried me. If the IB Diploma and most of my other uni courses are marathons, working on a SIGHT project was forest orienteering - but you get to design your own route too. There wasn’t even a defined destination - you decide on what you want to achieve, and the checkpoints to make in between. See a lake in front of you? Find yourself a raft or build a bridge. Yes, you can try to swim across as well. The teaching team won’t stop you, but they most certainly hope you won’t drown. Of course you can try to go around it, but the same challenge could come back to you later.
          </p>
          <p>There are still certain principles: a good project is one that clearly defines a pain point, identifies a gap in the market, carefully considers various aspects of the user experience, with well-designed user testing and responses to the feedback received.</p>
          <p>
          But these guiding principles are universal. It’s wholly up to us to decide whether CollaBox would be played on a joystick or an iPad, using puzzles or matching games, using robots or animals as characters and even if we want to reward students with stickers or trains or not at all. Entering an unknown world of Unity, C# and navigating ourselves from market research, all the way to our final product, the journey was
filled with doubt. Is this actually going to work? Does this code actually map to the joystick? Is this what it’s supposed to look like? Surprisingly, we were never lost. Through our many rounds of iterations and re-orienting, we always knew exactly where we were and had the same, consistent notion of what we wanted to achieve. Working on CollaBox has given me the confidence of finding my own path without having to know exactly what is ahead of us. There were times when I got frustrated with the monkey who refused to jump to the other side of the tree, as a result of our limited coding capacities; but my work felt so purposeful and I was so drawn to it that it was never a drag for me. Being able to work on something that you feel so strongly for, with the degree of freedom and support given is such a miraculous feeling.
          </p>
          <p>
          The environment at SIGHT also played a big role in morphing my take on working in team environments. I always felt comfortable, respected and that my input mattered, and I naturally wanted to stay with SIGHT when the project course ended. The
emails have always made me feel welcomed and made it clear that bureaucracy and hierarchies are not part of SIGHT. We play different roles, but everyone could have a casual conversation with anyone. I used to be extremely time conscious, task-oriented and hated social interactions. In my first SIGHT camp session, I internally cringed when Joel asked us to spin on our chairs, wondered why haven’t we started ideating yet and hoped my watch would read 20:00 so that I could have a good reason to escape from the chaotic Innolab. Yet it was also these moments which proved that relationships at SIGHT would never be transactional. There would be little rules, and much room for discussion and innovation. I was given space for my ideas to form
and eventually come to life, and not even once did I find the teaching team trying to impose anything on me.
          </p>
          <p>
          My first meeting as a SIGHT leader was a broad discussion of SIGHT’s goals and directions for the new academic year. Everyone else could make it at the proposed time while I couldn’t. It didn’t sound like something I as a student could contribute much towards, so I was expecting the meeting to go ahead without me. But they actually rearranged the meeting so that I could be there, and my thoughts were given no less weight than those of anyone else’s. Some of them eventually lead to actual changes. SIGHT is not just student-led at the project level, but we as leaders also take part in mentoring and the design of the program. From the style and design of SIGHT communications to the way the teaching team, leaders and even advisors presented themselves, I could always count on SIGHT to fill me with discussions, not confrontations nor persuasion. In general the SIGHT experience has slowly knocked down the walls I’ve surrounded myself with, teaching me how to trust and be trusted, and to interact not just for team building, but also because I genuinely wanted to. SIGHT has transformed my understanding of working with people. The atmosphere matters. A lot. This is carried into my netball and coaching as well.
          </p>
          <p>
          So that was the bildungsroman of me growing up in SIGHT. SIGHT has taught me to embrace spontaneity and be comfortable with finding my own path. Above all, I’ve learned much about people - how to find out what they need, how to work with them, and to appreciate the differences they could make. I hope I’ve left my mark here, but I’m sure I’ll be taking away so much more. If I ever watch Shriek again, I think Diya’s impression of the Gingerbread Man scene would be stuck in my head, whether I like it or not. If there’s one thing you should remember from this story, this is it: check your emails, don’t miss opportunities, take a leap of faith - you’ll never know where life leads you, but first you must give it a shot.

          I can never put to words how much I appreciate what SIGHT has given to me. My journey as a SIGHT camper to that of a leader has been a memorable one. Starting from their edgy interview style I was a fan. I remember making an RC drawing car for the interview and thinking to myself “Wow, I am already an engineer”. Then on I was offered to join the Caritas project where I would be developing technologies for SEN kids. Although my initial plan for the project was different, the sudden turning of everything to online made us go through a lot of changes. My team of 6 then came up with an idea to make collaborative video games for special kids.
          </p>
          <p>It was daunting. 6 people from diverse backgrounds, none of us knowing the ABC of coding but now committed to coding games and building a console! At that point it was the supportive SIGHT staff who pushed us and believed in us and said, “Don’t worry if you don’t know how to do it, we will show you a way”. They really lived up to their words. The greatest form of support is not holding you by your pinky finger, but letting you face challenges while constantly showing you your goal. This is exactly what SIGHT did – the advisors offered us an invisible helping hand. (Special shoutout to the God-like Kris who we’d go crying to every time we got stuck)</p>
          <p>
          The first time I wrote a little code and saw a block moving across the screen, I couldn’t wait to announce my big achievement to the world. For someone who was scared to even open and touch a code, successfully finishing up 4 working games felt so surreal. One of my team’s goals was also to make a video game console specially tailored for special kids. I remember just scribbling some design ideas on my room window with a marker (my mom wasn’t so happy about it). It took us more than 5 months to reach our goal and we
failed so many times, but somehow, it all seemed worth it when we stood in the room that day looking at kids play the games we coded with the console that we built. I was so proud of myself! I really wouldn’t have ever had the confidence to touch programming had it not been for SIGHT’s incredible staff and my lovely team. Now, I sometimes find myself making random games just for fun. Nothing seems impossible to me after this and that is when I realize that coming to HKUST was the best decision of my life.
          </p>
          <p>The best part of SIGHT is that I feel like I’m at home. Every single advisor, every classmate, and even the professor makes it a little family. I can easily express myself, talk to anyone if I face problems, and openly ask for help. And this extends beyond my work at SIGHT. I am so glad to have been a part of this family and I am extremely elated to have the opportunity to carry on this legacy as a SIGHT leader.</p>

          Students with Special Education Needs (SEN) are like ordinary Hong Kong students, they go to school and have lessons. However, the general public is not well educated on special education. There are also inadequate support for SEN students in the society, so we are very happy to have talented and capable students from SIGHT working on these problems. Their assistance has increased the SEN students’ capability to learn and enriched their leaning experience.
          </p>
          <p>SEN is a broad term that refers to the group of students who require assistance in education, physically and/or mentally. SEN students often need tailor-made solution for their unique needs, which is not commonly found on market due to small market size. Tight school budget and limited knowledge on new technology also hinder school from producing own solutions. Not all of our teachers and social workers have previous experience with SEN kids before joining the school, and it takes time to understand the actual situation and needs in the SEN environment, which is not much preferred in the society. Having students from SIGHT going into our campus and interacting with our students is definitely a good news and a good opportunity to increase the exposure of SEN students.</p>
          <p>Our previous engagement with SIGHT include washroom management system and educational tools development. In both projects, SIGHT students have promoted us to think about the possibility of having technology in school. Instead of adopting ready-to-use solution on market, students wrote own software and designed own games which were optimised to our students’ necessities and abilities. It is touching for us to see SIGHT students creating connections with our students and having the passion to serve SEN kids despite the time-consuming solution development and modification. There were also non-Hong Kong members on some of the teams, but the communication barrier did not stop them from working on the project. Their unique cultural background provided great perspectives on the solution as well. We really appreciate the learning environment SIGHT has created for students.</p>
          <p>Having collaboration with SIGHT is a great step for bringing our students closer to the outside world. However, resources and facilities available now in the community are insufficient to support students for going around the city. We hope that one day more people would be concerned of SEN, or at least have better understanding
on the challenges they are encountering, and that an inclusive community can be maintained to benefit every party in need.</p>
