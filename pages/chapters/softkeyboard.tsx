Some of their students suffer from muscular conditions such as dystrophy, yet they still need to attend classes and public examinations. They did so by having an oral scribe, which was often cumbersome.</p>

          <p className="first-letter:text-2xl sm:first-letter:text-4xl">SIGHT is an eye-opening journey for university students to have hands-on experience in solving real-world issues. While working as a member of the joystick keyboard team, I was given the opportunity to meet and get to understand the daily struggles of MPS patients. The idea of a joystick keyboard was thus generated with the hope of improving their efficiency in day-to-day computer usage.</p>
          <p>Through the implementation of the design thinking process, my team and I went through iterations of design, prototype, and testing. With the support of the SIGHT teaching team and advisors, we received constructive feedback that guides us
into a better-defined concept. During the time, I was encouraged to self-learn new concepts and techniques that could contribute to the product. I have also learned to observe and transform vague concepts/ opinions into feasible solutions to satisfy usersâ€™ needs.</p>
          <p>SIGHT is such a unique experience in UST, which allows students from different disciplines and perspectives to interact and come up with ideas to tackle the related problems. Though it is not always an easy task, it is crucial in producing a comprehensive product in the end.</p>
